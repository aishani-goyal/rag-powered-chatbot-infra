# RAG Chatbot Infrastructure

This repository contains the **infrastructure and configuration files** for deploying the RAG-Powered News Chatbot.  
It works alongside the [frontend](https://github.com/aishani-goyal/rag-powered-chatbot-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/aishani-goyal/rag-powered-chatbot-backend) repositories.

## 📂 Contents

- **`docker-compose.yml`** – Defines services like Redis and Qdrant for local development and deployment.  
- **`package.json` / `package-lock.json`** – Project metadata and shared scripts.  
- **`.gitignore`** – Ensures unnecessary files and folders are excluded.  

## 🔧 Purpose

- Provides an isolated place to manage infrastructure configuration.  
- Simplifies running dependencies locally (Redis, Qdrant).  
- Prepares the project for easy extension to CI/CD pipelines or cloud infrastructure.
